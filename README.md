# speedwaysingapore.github.io
A website made by [TheCommCraft](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TheCommCraft) to transfer my [repl.co](https://knightbot63.repl.co) site to [github.io](https://speedwaysingapore.github.io)
## What happens to the repl.co site?
That is still going to be there. Most likely reliable to github.io
